## Job Offer

Job and internship offers are delivered in various ways, at different times of the year, and with varying offer deadlines. Learning more about how each industry manages job offers will help reduce your stress in the process and help you be better prepared. Consider connecting with students and alumni who have worked at the companies you are interested in to learn more about their recruiting and job offer processes.

Four Factors to Consider when Evaluating a Job Offer

Whether you have several job offers from which to choose or just one, there are certain aspects to take into consideration. There are four major areas to keep in mind when evaluating a job offer. 
*1. Does this job fit with my career goals?* 

* Is this the kind of job I want? 
* Do my technical skills and areas of emphasis match the demands of the position? 
* How much will I have to learn, and is the company willing to train me? 
* Are my expectations about the position and the company appropriate? 
* Do salary and benefits meet my standards? Is money the most important factor given my career goals? 
* Does the position offer my security? 
* How am I motivated to do the job? 
* Are there opportunities for advancement and promotions? 
* Can I find the personal satisfaction and balance with other aspects of my life? 

*2. Is the Company culture in line with my work and life styles?*  The issue here is not culture in itself, but how the broader view of the world and values the company promotes will impact your work performance and satisfaction. Different points of view, values, and goals that are more subjective are inevitable in this increasingly diverse world of work, so how do I fit in it? 

* Is the company’s structure one that I would feel comfortable in? 
* Is the atmosphere one in which I feel I can work and be productive? 
* Do I think I will be compatible with the work environment? 
* Does my philosophy and life values work with that of the company’s? 

*3. What is the business strategy of the Company?*  The company is also goal oriented. Most of them are supported by its vision, purpose, mission statement, and business strategies, all designed to reflect the company’s core values. Your knowledge of what those would be might support you in your decision to work for that company or not. 

* What are the values that this company promotes to its employees and the community? 
* What is its reputation in the industry? How will the reputation of the organization impact the work I do? 
* Is the company financially sound? If not, what are other considerations I should be thinking of? 
* Does it have a profitable future? 

*4. Will my future boss (and staff) support my professional growth?*  Even though the company’s culture is a factor in your decision to work in a specific position, it is very important to consider if your personality is somewhat compatible with that of your boss (and the staff in general). Work styles and personalities, as related to the job, should be openly discussed so that mutual understanding is achieved and best results are obtained. You should consider: 

* Is there a structure within the company (i.e. training) that supports my professional growth? 
* What is my boss’ work style (and staff)? What is my work style? How do they fit together? 
* How issues are communicated with my boss/supervisor/co-workers? 
* What methods are used and how is the evaluation process conducted in this company? 
* Can my opinions be heard and considered?


## Negotiate job offers

As a job seeker it may seem daunting, but fortunately, most employers are prepared to negotiate and shouldn’t be surprised when the notion arises. If done tactfully, negotiating a job offer can be very beneficial to you and help you start off on the right foot with your new employer.

What Can Be Negotiated?

* Negotiable: Offer Deadline, Start Date, Salary, Signing Bonus, Relocation Expenses
* Sometimes Negotiable: Telecommuting, Position Title, Position Location, Performance Review Timing/Frequency, Non-Compete Agreements Timeframe
* Usually Non-Negotiable: Vacation, Health Insurance, Retirement Savings Plan, Non-Disclosure Agreements, Other benefits that apply to all employees

Negotiation in 10 Steps

1. *Initially Respond.* Respond gratefully even if the offer is below expectations. Ask to have some time to think about it, and agree on a response date.
2. *Understand the Offer.* Review the terms of the offer, and ask questions about job components, compensation, career advancement opportunities, stock options, benefits, time off, start date, etc.
3. *Conduct Extensive Research.* Know your market value–What are comparable salaries and positions? Learn more about pay equity (https://capd.mit.edu/channels/pay-equity/).
4. *Determine and Prioritize Your Needs and Wants.* Decide what is a need versus a want, and prioritize those most valuable to you. How well does the position as it stands meet your needs? Where are you flexible? Where are you not? What is the minimum you would accept for whatever element you are negotiating on? How much time do you need to make a decision on the offer? What is the lowest salary you will consider? How important is job security to you?
5. *Develop a Strategy.* Plan a realistic course of action based on solid preparation and a review of all resources, including your own strengths and weaknesses as a candidate. Only negotiate if you are seriously considering the offer. If you have other offers with pending deadlines be sure to time your negotiations accordingly, and don’t wait until the last minute.
6. *Contact the Organization.* Identify who is best to negotiate with — Human Resources? The hiring manager? Once you know, call the employer to present your items to be negotiated–be enthusiastic and reassure them of your interest in the position.
7. *Receive a Response to Your Offer.* The employer will inform you what requests they can and can’t fulfill. Remember, the worst thing they can say is “No”.
8. *Renegotiate If Necessary.* You may find it appropriate to conduct a second round of negotiation depending on the situation. Don’t be uncompromising or demanding–tact and reason are crucial in delicate circumstances such as this.
9. *Get Terms in Writing.* Always make sure you have an offer in writing prior to accepting to confirm all parties are on the same page.
10. *Decide.* Review your needs and goals to determine if the negotiated offer is the right fit. Ideally, you want to find a balance–the negotiation process will be a give-and-take scenario where each side (you and the employer) needs to feel the end result is win-win. Provide your response as soon as possible, especially if you decide to decline the offer.

Hi XXX,

Many thanks again for the warm welcome and for taking the time to chat last Friday.

Having all these insights on the tech+vision+product as well as a glimpse of what life at *** is like has definitely strengthened my motivation.
Like I said, this opportunity is exactly what I'm looking for in many aspects, so I'm very excited :)

Hi XXX and many thanks for accepting my invite ! 

Long story short, it's the dream of imagining and implementing better forms of collaboration between humans and AI through personalization that drove me all the way to the US. In the last few years, I have been working on this challenge: I have written papers on the interaction between recommendation and contextual bandits (submitted to Neurips 2022) and implemented deep learning-based recommendation systems in various contexts (for journalistic data and for language translation). I have also done a few other cool projects in the fields of deep learning, social sciences and neuroscience, always keeping in mind this big goal. 

Therefore, XXX's vision and goals in this area are perfectly aligned with what I've enjoyed doing and learning. That's why I just applied for an MLE position on personalization, as I finish my master at MIT. 

You may not be the right person to contact but I just wanted to let you know. Many thanks in advance for taking the time to read this! Please find my CV enclosed if it can help. 

Best,

Gauthier
