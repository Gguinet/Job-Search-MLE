## Thanks Mail

Hi XXX,

Many thanks again for the warm welcome and for taking the time to chat last Friday.

Having all these insights on the tech+vision+product as well as a glimpse of what life at *** is like has definitely strengthened my motivation.
Like I said, this opportunity is exactly what I'm looking for in many aspects, so I'm very excited :)

## Motivation Mail

Hi XXX and many thanks for accepting my invite ! 

Long story short, it's the dream of imagining and implementing better forms of collaboration between humans and AI through personalization that drove me all the way to the US. In the last few years, I have been working on this challenge: I have written papers on the interaction between recommendation and contextual bandits (submitted to Neurips 2022) and implemented deep learning-based recommendation systems in various contexts (for journalistic data and for language translation). I have also done a few other cool projects in the fields of deep learning, social sciences and neuroscience, always keeping in mind this big goal. 

Therefore, XXX's vision and goals in this area are perfectly aligned with what I've enjoyed doing and learning. That's why I just applied for an MLE position on personalization, as I finish my master at MIT. 

You may not be the right person to contact but I just wanted to let you know. Many thanks in advance for taking the time to read this! Please find my CV enclosed if it can help. 

Best,

Gauthier
