Practicing responses to these questions will be helpful for you before you walk into your behavioral interviews, but we also have some tips for you to follow so that you can nail your onsite behavioral interview. 

*Know the structure*

Every behavioral interview has the same structure: introduce yourself, resume deep dive, specific questions, why this company, your questions. Make sure you have your elevator pitch ready for the introduction. It should be 1-2 minutes and talk about your education, experience, projects, and conclude with a summary of yourself as a candidate and a preview of “why this company.”
When crafting a response to “why this company,” keep this structure in mind: Mission or product first, approach or values second (ex: “Nobody else approaches it like you. You’re being more scientific than ever before”). Avoid perks, salary, and everything else.

*Be specific*

You don’t want your answers to be too long, so it’s helpful to know what to be specific about. Focus on numbers, context, reasoning behind decisions, technologies or algorithms, and examples. 
So, rather than: “I built this awesome app that was like Google Maps for my office floor. There were a lot of really hard algorithms involved, but eventually, everyone really liked it.”
Say something like, “I developed an app to navigate between rooms on my office floor. I decided to use my own simplified version of A* search to do it, which ended up working pretty well since we were able to launch it to all 50 members of my team.”

*Mix “I” and “we”*

When it comes to taking credit, if you were on a team, use “I” to denote what your responsibilities were and be very clear and then use “we” to give your team credit for overall accomplishments. Alongside that, mention how grateful you are or how much you learned, to avoid sounding too much like you’re bragging.

*Stay focused*

We see this a lot where interviewees think that adding more information makes their answer better. And while it’s definitely important to tell your story and answer the question that they ask, but it’s better to have them ask for more info than for you to run on and on with your answer. For example, “There were 3 core features that I implemented to help us. At a high level, they were a revamped landing page, social media sharing, and referrals. Happy to go in more detail on any one of them if you’d like. With these features, we reached 100,000 views in a week.”

*Avoid negative language*

This is an opportunity for you to talk about the great work you’ve done. Even if the project wasn’t launched or it didn’t have the desired result, you don’t need to use negative language in your responses. Avoid overly pessimistic words like fail and disappoint, critical words like stupid or idiot, and self-degrading words like lazy or clueless. 
Here’s an example of something you can say if you didn’t get the desired result: “We were able to reach $40,000 in funding in our crowdfunding campaign, which was great, but we decided to use different strategies because we needed more funding to be successful. We looked into licensing, and continued development with what we could.”
With these questions and knowledge at hand, you should be able to go into your behavioral interviews prepared and with confidence.


## AWS leading principles

### Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

### Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

### Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

### Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

### Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

### Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

### Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

### Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

### Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

### Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

3 that stand out for scientific 

* Learn and Be Curious: In my interview conversations, I look for data points that show the candidate proactively seeking opportunities to learn new skills and improve themselves versus staying with familiar situations or avoiding new experiences.
* Dive Deep: I look for those who investigate and get details to solve a problem, even when faced with challenges, as opposed to having only a surface-level understanding of projects;
* Invent and Simplify: I look for those who generate new ideas or simplify a solution for long-term wins versus creating a cumbersome process to solve a short-term problem.
